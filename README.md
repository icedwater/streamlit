# Streamlit.io

Data visualization made easy, according to the creators. We shall see.

## Getting Started

This can be contained in a virtualenv later on, but [it seems][web] all we need
to start is the streamlit package itself.

    pip install streamlit
    streamlit hello

Then [documentation][doc] needs to be read, etc.
